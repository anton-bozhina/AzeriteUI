This is a custom user interface for World of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth, with a fresh new design and brand new custom codebase at its core. It's designed by Daniel Troko & coded by Lars "Goldpaw" Norberg. 

The motivation of this user interface is immersion. This game has SO much information that if not handled carefully becomes cumbersome, therefore blocking the most important asset of the game, the world. The best interface is no interface at all, but in a game such as this that is not possible. But if we have to block away parts of the game world to see information about the game mechanics, then at least letâ€™s make it dynamic, beautiful and in sync with the game's aesthetics. Let's make it Warcraft!  

Be aware that the expected download location of this user interface is either [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeriteui), the [Twitch App](https://app.twitch.tv/download), or [tagged releases](https://bitbucket.org/bigcogs/azeriteui/downloads/?tab=tags), and anything else should be considered developer versions or nightly builds and are unsupported when it comes to bugs or issues. 

## **How can I get more action buttons, and where are the pet- and stance bars?**  

The stance bar will be introduced as an optional feature in an upcoming update. The pet bar on the other hand will not. We do however plan to release this as a plugin for the UI at a later point. For now all your pet buttons can be placed on the normal actionbars.

For more buttons, right-click the cogwheel icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can have a maximum of 24 buttons, which in effect is the main actionbar and the bar known in the default interface as the "bottom left multi action bar". 

If you're looking for a very high amount of actionbuttons and for some reason is unwilling to adjust your playstyle to the UI yet insist on using it, then you can always use bartender to fill that button desire. Coupled with [our Masque skin](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-azerite) matching our actionbuttons you should still be able to maintain the look and feel to a certain degree. Just keep in mind that no support is given towards that goal, nor should you expect any changes to the UI to accomodate custom layouts. 

## **How can I move things?**  

You can't. This is as much UX as UI, meaning the interface is designed around a concept, this isn't meant to be a pretty skin over your current interface, it's instead a full user experience system where how you interact with the game is affected.

## **I found a bug, where to report?**  

Bugs are reported over at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/bigcogs/azeriteui/issues?status=new&status=open). You can also try hearing if the community over at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/MUSfWXd) has a solution, just keep in mind that it's not a helpdesk, the devs and mods are not there to answer your questions, and that in the end we're all just gaming enthusiasts.
